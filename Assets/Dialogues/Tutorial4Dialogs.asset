  - Excellent! You have learned everything you need to know!
  - Here are some helpful tips before I go, on the middle here is the Time Limit.
    Make sure that you keep track of the time when you are working!
  - On the left, you can see different orders made from the customers and they will
    progressively increase due time.
  - 'It tells you what order is being requested, the rewards you get after completing
    it, and possible time constraints for a specific order. '
  - If you finish an order quickly, you could probably get more rewards from it!
  - On the right is the Money and Ranking System, it records how much you earned
    for this level, the highest rank for each level will be 3 stars.
  - That is all! Good luck out there!
